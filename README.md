# amk-billboard-api

Working locally for now, where I am able to call my function in Node.js like so *http://localhost:8080/hot5/2020-02-21* to retrieve Billboard's top 5 songs on that particular day. Currently a work in progress, wanting to setup hosting next and find out what other cool info I can get.
